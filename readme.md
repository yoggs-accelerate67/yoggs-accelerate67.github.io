# ngClassifieds - Ultimate AngularJS Course Source Code

This is the source code for my course **[Ultimate AngularJS: Build a Real-World App from Scratch](http://codecollege.ca/courses/ultimate-angularjs-course?product_id=65869)** available on Code College and Udemy.

## Branches

Code is provided in different branches for three major sections of the course.

* **End of Section 7** - The basic app
* **End of Section 8** - Routing with UI Router
* **End of Section 10** = The complete app with the directive example

Toggle the branch above to find the code for the section you're working on. 

To run the app, first install the dependencies with NPM.

```bash
npm install
```

Then serve the app with whichever web server you like. You can use **http-server** for a quick solution.

```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server
```
